# Regression---Streaming-Service-Customer-Churn-Analysis-of-Poisonous-Mushrooms
In this project, I utilized business churn data to predict the probability of whether a customer of a streaming service will "churn", i.e., stop being a customer. Additionally, I utilized mushroom data to predict the probability of a mushroom being poisonous. 

**Key Highlights**
- Streaming Service Churn: Utilized Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting Trees models to predict customer churn for a streaming service.
    - Recommended targeted content strategies and improving model calibration.
- Mushroom Poisoning Prediction: Analyzed mushroom data using Categorical Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression Models.
    - Designed a mushroom safety prediction function to classify mushrooms as poisonous or safe with high reliability.
- Explored various machine learning models and interpreted key performance metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, ROC AUC).

**Models Built**
